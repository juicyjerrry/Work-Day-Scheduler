This is my version of the Work Day Scheduler
its purpose is to allow for easier scheduling during a typical workday by allowing local storage events to be called
additionally, the webpage reads the time and indicates in red what the current time is, in green what events are comign, and in grey what events have passed.

![A user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events.](./05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)
